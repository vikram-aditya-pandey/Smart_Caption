# üì∏ Smart Image Caption Generator

A **Streamlit web app** that generates Instagram-style captions for your uploaded images using a locally hosted **Ollama LLaVA model** (vision-language model). Add optional context to tailor your captions for vacations, events, or product posts!

---

## üöÄ Features

* Upload any `.jpg`, `.jpeg`, or `.png` image
* Get natural-language captions for Instagram or other social media
* Optional: Add custom context for more relevant captioning
* Uses the **LLaVA** model via **Ollama** running locally

---

## üñºÔ∏è How It Works

1. Upload an image via the Streamlit interface
2. (Optionally) enter context like *‚Äúsunset at the beach‚Äù*
3. The app sends the image and prompt to the **Ollama LLaVA model** running at `localhost:11434`
4. Displays a smart caption based on the image and context
